# The Trust counsel
Platform connecting asylum seekers and refugees with trusted solicitors in the UK, (legal aid and private) backed by transparent community ratings.

## 🎯 Mission
Empower vulnerable people to quickly connect with credible, effective legal support, expose bad actors, and make justice more accessible.

## 💡 Why This Exists
- Confusing market: Too many firms, little clarity on quality.
- Legal aid gaps: Strict eligibility and limited availability mean not everyone qualifies; having access to trusted private solicitors is essential for many cases.
- Accountability: Ratings contribute to trust but are only one part of ensuring solicitor quality.

## 🔍 Core Features (MVP)
- Solicitor directory: search by location, expertise, and legal‑aid status.
- Ratings and reviews: public feedback on responsiveness and outcomes.
- AI-assisted document handling: help users organize, format, and track case documents.
- AI-guided self-representation: step-by-step guidance for users representing themselves, offering non-legal, signposted help.
